I created this program using **NetBeans IDE**. It should run perfectly fine, and the files are all already connected to each other. It runs similarly to the first assignment! Just need to have **all** the files downloaded.

I will also upload pictures of the program running. I also went through commenting most operations/parts. Files will be in a folder. Download & run in your selected IDE, NetBeans preferred as I am not completely positive how this works in other IDE's, regardless the process should be similar. 

**Hope everything goes smoothly!**
